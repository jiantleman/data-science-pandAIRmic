# Socio-historical and Impact Report

## Socio-historical Context

***Research the socio-historical context of your project to identify a few societal factors that could affect your data, prediction goal, and/or hypothesis. These factors might include current or historical policies, events, social conditions, larger societal systems, and more. Describe a few of the broader societal issues and their relationship to your data, prediction goal, and/or hypothesis.***

The societal factors that determine the impact of COVID-19 on different US states are multi-faceted and complex. One of the most significant drivers is ethnicity.  According to [The Covid Racial Data Tracker](https://covidtracking.com/race), COVID-19 affects Black, Latinx, indigenous and other people of color the most. Nationwide, black people have died at 1.4 times the rate of white people. Poverty levels and healthcare access are also correlated with demography, meaning that there is potentially a disconnect between our independent variable data (flight passengers who are likely to have higher income) and dependent variable (COVID-19 cases in each state). Political ideologies also heavily influence COVID-19 impacts across states. For instance we see that conservative state governments are  less inclined to impose strict public health measures (mask mandates, social distancing), and this factor can impact our data.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people of Asian origin have experienced xenophobia in the United States and across the world because of a perceived fear that they are more likely to be infected with the coronavirus, and aviation has been one area where people have been particularly affected. For example, in February last year, the flight crew on a KLM flight between South Korea and the Netherlands instructed Korean passengers not to use the restroom due to their perceived increased likelihood of having COVID-19.  We should be careful to cautiously present our results in a manner that does not further stoke xenophobia or fear against people of any race, origin, or state for that matter, especially groups like the Asian community which have already suffered from such beliefs.

***Who are the major stakeholders in this project? What is your relationship to these stakeholders? Stakeholders are those who may be affected by or have an effect on your project topic. Some examples of stakeholders are a particular demographic group, residents of a particular geographic area, and people experiencing or at risk for a particular problem.***

Since our project data concerns nationwide COVID-19 impacts in the US, the stakeholders of our project include  individuals who are at risk of getting impacted by COVID-19, air travelers, and state government/health institutions that might be interested in developing policies that concern the impact of aviation travelling on the spread of infectious diseases.

***Summarize the most relevant technical or non-technical research that has already been conducted about your project topic. If relevant, what was the societal impact of existing research?***

The [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7655026/) on our project topic mainly revolves around the risk of in-flight transmission and how airports/airlines can implement health precautions, but we are unable to find substantive research that explore the impact of air travelling on the COVID-19 cases of a region/state. There are also substantial research on the economic impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry.

## Ethical Considerations

***What kind of underlying historical or societal biases might your data contain? How can this bias be mitigated?***

Positive COVID-19 tests, of course, can only be collected from people who are given COVID-19 tests. People without health insurance or with lower incomes may not receive COVID-19 tests as often as others, and similarly people living in predominantly minority areas may have less testing options nearby (Brown is a great example -- all of us are tested twice per week, while many people just down the street in Providence have never received a test). As a result, the COVID-19 data is biased towards people with better access to health care and COVID-19 testing and should be carefully considered. Similarly, most people who fly have higher incomes compared to those who do not, and only reflect data for those communities. As a result, we should consider who is actually flying and who is not when analyzing our data.

***What biases might exist in your interpretation of the data?***

Our prior knowledge about various COVID-19 measures informs us on how to weigh each factor in affecting COVID infection rates.

***How could an individual or particular community’s privacy be affected by the aggregation or analysis of your data?***

Thankfully, it would be near impossible for anyone personally to be affected by the aggregation or analysis of our data given that the T100 data is simply reported a sum of passengers, while the DB1B is an anonymous record of people flying between two cities in a given year. Similarly, due to HIPPA protections, all COVID-19 data will be similarly anonymized. However, we should consider when reporting our data not to scapegoat any one state or city in order to bias others against that location.

***Is data being used in a manner agreed to by the individuals who provided the data?***

Technically, no one has explicitly agreed to the collection of their data, but there is certain implicit agreement. Passengers know that both airlines and the government know who is flying at any given time (TSA, boarding passes, etc.), and while they may not know their flight data is being released to the public, it is in such a way that is totally anonymous, either by aggregation or vagueness -- for example, knowing that two people flew between Las Vegas and Dallas sometime in the third quarter of 2020 is not exactly breaking news. Similarly, while patients receiving a COVID-19 test might not be explicitly told that their test information is published, this can largely be assumed due to the fact that COVID-19 cases are reported on the news every night and the data is sufficiently anonymized by aggregation. So overall, the data is being used in a way that does not violate users’ expectations.

***What are possible misinterpretations or misuses of your project results and what can be done to prevent them?***

If infection rates do correlate strongly with air travel, then this might cause airlines to accelerate their adoption of requiring a proof of COVID-19 vaccination before allowing a passenger to board their flight. The access to COVID-19 vaccines is highly skewed towards rich, developed nations and communities. Thus, this will negatively affect people without health insurance, or communities with lower income in the US itself, and outside of the US this will discriminate against developing countries with less access to vaccine doses.
